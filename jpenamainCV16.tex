	{\jobtitle{Project Manager: Santosh Mathan \newline Supervisor: Michael Dillard}}\\
IARPA-funded program developing a cutting-edge regimen of game-based cognitive training and brain stimulation, designed to improve ﬂuid intelligence. Worked in collaboration with Oxford University, Harvard University, Northeastern University and Simcoach Entertainment to develop a game-based training grounded in psychological theory, which targets unique combinations of component processes of ﬂuid intelligence (Robot Factory). The task set served as the foundation of the adaptive training game, which has since been nominated for several awards at the Serious Games Showcase \& Challenge. Participated in data collection efforts with the MITRE corporation serving as a test administrator which involved directly interfacing with participants such as consenting, recruiting, and screening as well as administering their test sessions.
